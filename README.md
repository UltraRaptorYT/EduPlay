## ‚ú® Inspiration
The inspiration behind Cotton Pickers EduPlay was the current lack of Student Engagement in todays Post-Covid Era. With the increased reliance on technology for learning, we recognized the opportunity to create an application that would provide a comprehensive and engaging educational experience for students across all levels of education.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüéì What it does
Cotton Pickers EduPlay is a one-stop education platform that digitalizes classroom learning. You can bring MOE textbooks of ANY subject to life with our Interactive AR. We use augmented reality (AR) technology to enable students to explore 360-degree, 3D animated diagrams from their textbooks using their phone camera. 

We also have made a Virtually Unlimited Interactive Whiteboard using AI. EduPlay provides Behavioral and Cognitive engagement of students through its drawing tools. Students and Teachers can now interact on a whole new plane. 

Imagine a classroom, where the teacher can just draw equations and explain lessons using just their fingers and laptop webcam! Imagine a student who can just raise their hand, and draw on the whiteboard right from their seat. Writing in the air feels magical. Students can then bring their MOE textbooks to life, exploring interactive 3d Models of their lesson materials from Biology to Chemistry to Physics!

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª How we built it
The team behind Cotton Pickers EduPlay built the application using a combination of software development technologies and educational expertise. The interactive lessons and augmented reality features were developed using AR development frameworks and 3D modeling tools such as open source MindFrame and Streamlit for web apps. The engaging drawing tools incorporated computer vision and AI technology to enable gesture-based interactions. We built the gesture detection AI first from scratch, then using MediaPipe to transfer learn and fine tune the detection. The application was designed to be compatible with mobile devices, ensuring accessibility for students. No fuss of downloading anything

## üí• Challenges we ran into
During the development of Cotton Pickers EduPlay, the team faced several challenges. One of the challenges was integrating the augmented reality technology seamlessly into the application to provide an immersive and interactive experience. We overcame technical hurdles and optimizing the performance of the AR features by using opensource MindFrame framework. 

Another challenge was developing the drawing tools to accurately interpret hand gestures and provide a smooth user experience. We transfer learned our Gesture Detection with MediaPipe to make a responsive AI. Balancing the educational content with engaging gamified activities was also a challenge. We decided to use existing infrastructure like MOE textbooks to ensure seamless usage of our AR and AI, without the need to buy/download anything else.

## üòÑ Accomplishments that we're proud of
The team at Cotton Pickers EduPlay is proud of several accomplishments. Firstly, We successfully developed an application that combines education and entertainment, making the learning journey more enjoyable for young students. The integration of augmented reality technology and the creation of visually stimulating 3D animated diagrams were significant achievements. The team also takes pride in developing drawing tools that utilize computer vision and AI, enabling students to express their creativity while learning. Lastly, we are proud of every bug we fixed. Reading through the documentation several times surely got us a solid understanding of the technologies to use in our future projects!üòÅ

## üéì What we learned
During the development of Cotton Pickers EduPlay, the team gained valuable insights and knowledge. We learned about the technical aspects of integrating augmented reality into educational applications and the challenges involved in optimizing performance and user experience. They also deepened their understanding of how to create engaging and interactive lessons that cater to the needs of young students. Additionally, the team learned about the potential of computer vision and AI technology in enhancing educational tools and fostering creativity.


## üëÄ  What's next for Cotton Pickers EduPlay
For Cotton Pickers EduPlay, the future holds exciting possibilities. The team plans to expand the application with more features to cater to students of all grade levels and difficulties. They aim to diversify the subjects and topics covered, introducing Math, Geography and History. 

Additionally, the team intends to make this project into a startup, after consulting educators and business mentors. We envision EduPlay to be everywhere, from Pre-schools, to Primary schools to even Polytechnics. Every boring chapter becomes fun with AR visualization and AI interactability. One sector we want to target specifically is Tuition Centers in Singapore. Given the small classroom size, we can be sure EduPlay can introduce Play into Education for every child
